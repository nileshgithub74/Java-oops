1. Class : A class is a user-defined  blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all obejects of one type.


2. Objects : 
            it is an instance of the class.
            its  a real- world entity that has state and behavior.


in real life  , when   we have to construct the building , for that we first of all,  we draw the prototype of buildings on the papers --- this is class,
but in real life -- when  we built that actula house that is the  objects.


There are 4 types of Oops : 
  1. Encapsulation 
  2. Abstraction 
  3. Inheritance
  4. Polymorphism




1. Encapsulation : 
                  
                 Encapsulation is method to wrape the  variables and methods into single entity and restrict to direct access to  using them  keyboard priate.



    encapsulation : data hiding + controlled access

 Real Life example :  like medical medicine (capsule)
When you have a bank account,
you can’t directly take money from the bank’s system —
you must use official ways like an ATM, UPI, or bank teller.

The balance (data) is kept private,
and you can only access or change it through specific actions (methods).




2. Inheritance : It is the property of oops in which the  subclass aquire the property and method of parent class.

 Types of Inheritance :
     1. Single Inheritance  
     2. Multi-level Inheritance 
     3. multipule Inheritance
     4. Hierarchical Inheritance
     5. Hybrid Inheritance
